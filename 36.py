'''
=> .
    (Dot.) In the default mode, this matches any character except a newline. 
    If the DOTALL flag has been specified, 
    this matches any character including a newline.
    
=> []
    Used to indicate a set of characters. In a set:
    -> Characters can be listed individually, e.g. [amk] will match 'a', 'm', or 'k'.
    -> Ranges of characters can be indicated by giving two characters and separating them by a '-', 
        for example [a-z] will match any lowercase ASCII letter, 
    -> [0-5][0-9] will match all the two-digits numbers from 00 to 59, 
    -> [0-9A-Fa-f] will match any hexadecimal digit.
    -> If - is escaped (e.g. [a\-z]) or if itâ€™s placed as the first or last character (e.g. [-a] or [a-]), it will match a literal '-'.
    -> Special characters lose their special meaning inside sets. 
        For example, [(+*)] will match any of the literal characters '(', '+', '*', or ')'.
